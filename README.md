This is a [Godot 4.6](https://godotengine.org/) project with a bunch of compositor effects I've made. Hopefully, it'll help you on your journey to learning how to make your own!
Here's a list of the compositor effects currently included:
- Sample Effect. This effect lets you preview some of the different buffers you have access to when using compositor effects.
- Outline. This effect adds a depth-based outline around objects.
- Pixelate. This effect pixelates the screen and adds pixel outlines/highlights.
- Ray-tracing. This effect demonstrates how to render ray-traced spheres.
